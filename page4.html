        <h1>Anime</h1>
        <p>
          The word anime — pronounced "ah-knee-may" — is an abbreviation of the
          word animation. In Japan, the word is used to refer to all animation.
          However, outside of Japan, it has become the catch-all term for
          animation from Japan. For decades, anime was produced by and for Japan
          — a local product, with a distinct look-and-feel to not just the
          artwork but the storytelling, the themes, and the concepts. Over the
          last forty years, it has become an international phenomenon,
          attracting millions of fans and being translated into many languages.
          A whole generation of viewers in the West has grown up with it and are
          now passing it on to their own children. Because all things anime tend
          to be lumped together, it's tempting to think of anime as a genre. It
          isn't, at least no more than animation itself is a genre, but rather a
          description of how the material is produced. Anime shows, like books
          or movies, fall into any number of existing genres: comedy, drama,
          sci-fi, action-adventure, horror and so on.
        </p>
        <h4>What Makes Anime So Special?</h4>
        <p>
          Most anime fans can sum this up in two words: "It's different." Anime
          is as unlike most American cartoons like "Batman" and "Spider-Man" are
          different from the comics that run in daily papers. These differences
          show up in many ways including the artwork storytelling, breadth of
          material and even cultural nuances exhibited by the characters. Anime
          art styles range from the flamboyant and outlandish in shows like
          "Samurai Champloo" and " FLCL" to the simple and direct in shows like
          "Azumanga Daioh!." That said, even shows with more "basic" artwork can
          still be visually striking. Anime has this way of making everything
          look fresh and new. It doesn't shy away from epic storylines, either,
          which often run for dozens (sometimes hundreds) of episodes. The best
          anime, though, no matter what their length, all demand great emotional
          involvement from the viewer. The sheer range of anime shows out there
          means a fan of most any other kind of TV or movie can find an anime
          series that mirrors its style. For fans of hard science fiction, the
          show "Planetes" would be perfect for you; romantic comedy fans will
          love "Fruits Basket" while crimefighting lovers will enjoy "Ghost in
          the Shell." There are even adaptations of classical literature like
          "The Count of Monte Cristo." Not only that, fans of anime also get an
          intimate look into Japan's history, language and worldview, woven into
          a great deal of anime on many levels. Some shows are takeoffs on
          Japanese history like "Sengoku Basara" or raid Japanese mythology for
          story ideas like "Hakkenden" or "Hell Girl." Even shows that are
          outwardly non-Japanese in their presentation like "Claymore" and
          "Monster" have tinges of a Japanese sensibility to them. What's most
          striking is how anime's impact is coming full circle. Some recent
          American cartoon productions, like "Avatar: The Last Airbender," are
          openly inspired by anime itself, and live-action English-language
          versions of anime titles are starting to come into production more
          frequently.
        </p>
        <h4>Is Anime Okay for Young Kids?</h4>
        <p>
          Because anime's so broad-reaching in its subject matter, it's possible
          to find anime aimed at just about every age group. Some titles are
          specifically for younger viewers or are suitable for all ages like the
          animated series "Pokémon" or Studio Ghibli film "My Neighbor Totoro"
          while others are aimed at teenage audiences and older like "InuYasha."
          There are even some animes aimed at older teens like "Death Note" and
          some for mature audiences only like "Monster" and "Queens Blade."
          Japanese cultural attitudes about sexuality and violence require some
          titles to be placed a category higher than they might normally be.
          Nudity, for instance, is handled much more casually in Japan;
          sometimes a show that isn't meant specifically for adults will have
          material which may seem racy to Western viewers. Anime distributors
          are generally quite conscious of these issues and will include either
          an actual MPAA rating (G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17) or a TV Parental
          Guidelines rating as an indicator of what the intended audience is for
          the show. Check the show's packaging or program listing to see which
          rating applies. Confused about where to start? We recommend checking
          out the sci-fi, cyberpunk "Cowboy Bebop" or a swords-and-sorcery tale
          called "Berserk." If you already know a friend who's an anime fan,
          clue them in on what you like to watch — they should be able to guide
          you towards what's best and what's new in that category.

        <h4>Death Note</h4>
        <p>
          In the dark, desolate world of shinigamis (death gods), a bored
          shinigami named Ryuk decides to come to the human world. There, he
          drops his Death Note, a book that shinigamis use to kill people.
          Anyone who's name is written in the Death Note will die within 40
          seconds, and the time, place, and method of death can also be
          controlled. Ryuk's Death Note is soon found by Light Yagami, an
          intelligent but insensitive high school student. Since Light touched
          the Death Note, Ryuk becomes visible to him. Ryuk explains to Light
          how to use the Death Note (all the instructions are also written in
          the book itself), and Light decides to use the Death Note's power to
          cleanse the world of all criminals and create a new, "perfect" world.
          Secretly, and unbeknown to anyone, even his father who's a police
          officer, Light looks up every criminal he can find and uses the Death
          Note to kill them. After a while, authorities from around the world
          take notice of the mysterious mass deaths of their criminals and
          decide that someone must be behind it all. The unknown murderer,
          nicknamed "Kira," becomes a major news item, heralding both people who
          support and are against his "divine punishment" of criminals. The
          police force finally decides to hire the legendary detective L to
          figure out exactly who Kira is. Kira's whereabouts are traced back to
          Japan and Light's father becomes chief of the police force that is
          investigating Kira, totally unaware that his own son is the very
          person he's seeking. A battle of wits ensues between Light and L, as
          Light becomes more obsessed with the Death Note's power and continues
          to baffle the world with his mysterious, discreet murders, and L keeps
          getting closer and closer to discovering Kira's true identity. But in
          spite of L's wits being a good match for his own, Light remains
          confident in his task of using the Death Note to abolish evil in the
          world and create a new world with him as the "god." Even when new
          obstacles arise, such as Misa, a hyperactive supermodel who also has a
          Death Note and a huge crush on Light, the Yotsuba company who are
          after Kira too, Mikami Teru, a man who believes Kira is "god" and he
          is meant to serve Kira's wishes, and the SPK, another detective agency
          lead by Near who is meant to follow in L's footsteps. But even with
          all these complications that arise, Light's amazing intelligence
          continues to keep him one step ahead of his pursers. However, as he
          becomes more obsessed with the power of the Death Note, he seems to
          lose his own humanity. When he's able to unfaltering kill anyone who
          may be a threat to his plans, even if they haven't done anything
          wrong, it becomes obvious that the Death Note is the one controlling
          Light instead of vice versa. Light's original intention of creating a
          pure world turns into an ego trip for him with the people around him
          as pawns. Light's actions and further descent into obsession with the
          Death Note brings up the question of whether a single human being
          should ever be in possession of such non-human power.

        <h4>Hunter x Hunter</h4>

        <p>
          The story follows a young boy named Gon Freecss, who was told all his
          life that both his parents were dead. But when he learns from Kite, an
          apprentice of his father Ging Freecss, that he is still alive and has
          since become an accomplished Hunter, Gon leaves his home on Whale
          Island to take the Hunter Examination in order to become a Hunter like
          him.During the exam, Gon meets and soon befriends three of the other
          applicants: Kurapika, the last remaining member of the Kurta clan who
          wishes to become a Hunter in order to avenge his clan and recover
          their scarlet-glowing eyes that were plucked from their corpses by a
          band of thieves known as the Phantom Troupe; Leorio, a prospective
          physician who, in order to pay for medical school, desires the
          financial benefits that Hunters receive; and Killua Zoldyck, another
          twelve-year-old boy who has left his former life as a member of the
          world's most notorious assassin family. Among many other examinees,
          Gon continuously encounters Hisoka, a mysterious and deadly transmuter
          who takes an interest in him. After passing by many trials together,
          Gon and his friends end up passing the exam except for Killua, who
          fails after killing another applicant due to being controlled by his
          brother, Illumi, and runs away to his family's estate in shame.
        </p>
        <p>
          After Gon and the others convince Killua to rejoin their side, Leorio
          and Kurapika depart temporarily for their own personal reasons, while
          Gon and Killua set for the Heavens Arena, a skyscraper where thousands
          of martial artists compete daily in fighting tournaments, seeking to
          improve themselves, and gain monetary rewards.There they meet a kung
          fu master named Wing, who trains them in utilizing Nen, a Qi-like life
          energy used by its practicers to manifest parapsychological abilities,
          and is also considered to be the final requirement to pass the Hunter
          Exam. Sometime later, Gon and his friends reunite again in Yorknew
          City where they have a clash with the Phantom Troupe. During the
          occasion, Two from the band of thieves are killed by Kurapika and he
          is forced to give up the chance of hunting down the rest. In order to
          rescue Gon and Killua, who were captured by them, but not without
          succeeding in sealing the powers of their leader Chrollo Lucilfer. A
          few days later, Gon and Killua achieve their objective and begin
          playing Greed Island, an extremely rare and expensive video game with
          Nen-like properties following some clues about Ging's whereabouts.
          While exploring the game, it is revealed that its scenario is actually
          set somewhere in the real world, created with Nen by none other than
          Ging himself. Outclassed by the difficulty of the challenges in the
          game at first, they are soon joined and trained by Biscuit Krueger, an
          experienced teacher of Nen and kung fu master. With the help of
          Biscuit, Gon and Killua train their Nen and learn to shape their
          abilities to their traits. During their stay on Greed Island, Killua
          takes a short break to apply for the Hunter Examination again, this
          time passes with success. The trio then complete the game together
          against all odds and Gon obtains the right to choose the artifacts
          from the game necessary to reunite with his father.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Gon decides to have Killua accompany him to meet his father
          using the artifacts, but they send them to meet Kite instead. The duo
          then decide to help with Kite's research, and upon discovering a giant
          insect limb the group discovers that it came from a man-sized Chimera
          Ant queen. An insect that devours other creatures and then gives birth
          to progeny that inherit the characteristics of the different species
          it has eaten. The queen washes up onto an island nation called the
          Neo-Green Life (N.G.L.) Autonomous Region, where she quickly develops
          a taste for humans and builds a colony powerful enough to overcome the
          population, especially after her offspring learn the power of Nen
          after consuming some Hunters. Upon facing the Royal Guard of the
          Chimera Ants, Kite sacrifices himself to allow Gon and Killua to flee
          and alert the Hunter Association. After weeks of preparation, the
          Association sends a team of some of their most powerful Hunters,
          including Netero, the president of the Association himself to defeat
          the Ants and their king Meruem, whose subjects secretly overthrew the
          government of the nearby Republic of East Gorteau (東ゴルトー共和国)
          as part of their plan of subduing all of mankind. Despite losing to
          Meruem in combat, Netero ends up killing him with a bomb implanted in
          his body that poisons him to death soon after. In the occasion, Gon
          has a showdown with Neferpitou, the Ant who killed Kite and despite
          having exacted his revenge is hospitalized and in critical condition.
          After the Chimera Ant incident is resolved, the Hunter Association's
          top echelons the Zodiacs, from which Ging is a member, begin the
          process of choosing Netero's replacement as Chairman, while Killua
          returns home to ask for his younger sister Alluka to save Gon's life.
          However, his family is unwilling to risk losing Alluka or having her
          dangerous powers used against them, but after evading his older
          brother Illumi's attempts to intercept him, Killua manages to bring
          Alluka to Gon's side and have him fully recovered, before sealing her
          powers completely to ensure that she can have a normal life. Killua
          then parts ways with Gon, as he wants to travel the world with Alluka
          who had never seen the outside world before, while Gon himself finally
          meets his father and learns the true nature of his quest. Some time
          later, Netero's son Beyond assembles an expedition to the Dark
          Continent (暗黒大陸, Ankoku Tairiku). The forbidden, vast area outside
          of the known world that is sponsored by the Kingdom of Kakin. Fearing
          that the expedition may bring disaster to the world, just like it
          occurred in previous attempts, the world's five greatest powers accept
          that Kakin join their ranks in exchange for full authority over its
          findings. To accompany Beyond and prevent him from doing something
          unexpected, the Zodiacs decide to watch over him and invite Kurapika
          and Leorio to join them. While replacing Ging and the former
          Vice-Chairman Pariston, who assembled their own Dark Continent
          exploration teams by Beyond's request.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Hisoka and Chrollo had their fight in Heaven's Tower.
          Chrollo designed a sophisticated strategy and applied a combination of
          stolen skills that overwhelmed and killed Hisoka. Still, before dying,
          Hisoka used his Nen on his heart to wake his heart after death, and
          the tactic worked because Nen becomes stronger after death. After
          waking up, Hisoka humiliated Machi and killed both Kortopi and
          Shalnark, vowing to hunt the Phanton Troupe and kill it leg for leg
          before killing Chrollo. Aboard Kakin's expedition's ship, the fourteen
          princes of Kakin take part in a battle to the death called Succession
          War to decide the next king. In an attempt to recruit Kurapika to the
          Zodiacs, Mizaistom Nana tells him that the 4th prince of Kakin has an
          extensive collection of eyes from the Kurta Clan. Upon learning that,
          Kurapika immediately joins the Zodiacs as Pariston's substitute and
          infiltrates the royalty's security force along Pro Hunters he hired
          from the Hunter Association, most notable Izunavi, Basho, Melody,
          Biscuit, and Hanzo. Kurapika was hired to be the 14th prince's
          bodyguard and placed his fellow Pro Hunters strategically as
          bodyguards to other princes. Members of the Phantom Troupe (joined by
          Illumi) also infiltrate the ship targeting the treasures stored in the
          boat and revenge on Hisoka, who they suspect is boarded in the boat
          too. As the Succession War starts, Kurapika learns that the elder
          princes were in an advantageous position, as they were already
          preparing for the war for a long time. To revert the situation and
          create a stalemate position where he could help himself and the
          younger princes to survive, Kurapika warns every prince and bodyguard
          about Nen and start teaching Nen to the royalty's security members who
          were not aware of Nen. Mizaistom and Botobai were investigating
          homicides inside the boat. They took notice of the consequences of the
          princes' struggles, and their ties to the mafia, in the lower parts of
          the ship and started to take measures to avoid chaos and genocide
          inside the boat. The Phantom Troupe also takes notice of the existence
          of Kakin princes' ties to the mafia. While hunting Hisoka, Phinks,
          Feitan, and Nobunaga start to get close to the mafia faction tied to
          the 4th prince of Kakin, right at the moment when a mafia war on the
          lower levels starts.
