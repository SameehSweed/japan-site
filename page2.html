          The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese
          cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945,
          respectively, with the consent of the United Kingdom, as required by
          the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings killed between 129,000 and
          226,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and remain the only use
          of nuclear weapons in armed conflict. In the final year of World War
          II, the Allies prepared for a very costly invasion of the Japanese
          mainland. This undertaking was preceded by a conventional and
          firebombing campaign which devastated 67 Japanese cities. The war in
          Europe had concluded when Germany signed its instrument of surrender
          on May 8, 1945, and the Allies turned their full attention to the
          Pacific theater. The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of
          the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July
          26, 1945, the alternative being "prompt and utter destruction". Japan
          ignored the ultimatum and the war continued.
        </p>
        <p>
          By August 1945, the Allies' Manhattan Project had produced two types
          of atomic bombs, and the 509th Composite Group of the United States
          Army Air Forces (USAAF) was equipped with the specialized Silverplate
          version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress that could deliver them from
          Tinian in the Mariana Islands. The Allies issued orders for atomic
          bombs to be used on four Japanese cities on July 25. On August 6, one
          of the modified B-29s dropped a uranium gun-type bomb ("Little Boy")
          on Hiroshima. Another B-29 dropped a plutonium implosion bomb ("Fat
          Man") on Nagasaki three days later. The bombs immediately devastated
          their targets. Over the next two to four months, the acute effects of
          the atomic bombings killed between 90,000 and 146,000 people in
          Hiroshima and 39,000 and 80,000 people in Nagasaki; roughly half of
          the deaths in each city occurred on the first day. Large numbers of
          people continued to die for months afterward from the effects of
          burns, radiation sickness, and other injuries, compounded by illness
          and malnutrition. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians,
          although Hiroshima had a sizable military garrison.
        </p>

        <p>
          Japan surrendered to the Allies on August 15, six days after the
          Soviet Union's declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki. The
          Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on September 2
          in Tokyo Bay, which effectively ended World War II. Scholars have
          extensively studied the effects of the bombings on the social and
          political character of subsequent world history and popular culture,
          and there is still much debate concerning the ethical and legal
          justification for the bombings.

          On March 11, 2011, at 2:46 p.m. local time, a magnitude-9.0 earthquake
          ruptured a 500-kilometer-long fault zone off the northeast coast of
          Japan. Its epicenter was 130 kilometers off Sendai, Honshu; it
          occurred at a relatively shallow depth of 32 kilometers. The temblor
          violently shook northeast Honshu for six minutes, and collapsed its
          coastline by one meter. The thrusting moved Honshu about 2.4 meters
          eastward, and the seismic waves on the Pacific Ocean floor set off
          tsunami waves traveling at the speed of a jet plane (about 700
          kilometers per hour). Waves 3 to 38 meters tall pounded Honshu’s
          coastline, destroying towns and villages and flooding areas up to 10
          kilometers inland. Tsunami waves also swept across the Pacific,
          causing damage or disruptions in Hawaii, California, Oregon,
          Washington and British Columbia. Casualties from the earthquake and
          tsunami in Japan may be 30,000. More than 125,000 buildings have been
          washed away or seriously damaged; property damage is estimated to be
          more than $310 billion. Japan is used to dealing with seismic hazards,
          but the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami (as it has been
          officially named) were unusual even for Japan. History will record
          this event as among the world’s worst natural disasters, but
          geoscience textbooks will discuss it because of certain rare
          characteristics. Words like tsunami, kazan (volcano), danso (fault),
          jishin (earthquake) and typhoon (hurricane) are basic vocabulary in
          Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The country lies on the circum-Pacific Ring of Fire where Earth’s
          largest and fastest-moving tectonic plate (the Pacific Plate) is
          subducting at a rate of several centimeters per year beneath several
          other plates along deep trenches. This subduction has been producing
          earthquakes and volcanic eruptions along the Pacific rim for millions
          of years, since the Cretaceous. Nevertheless, the March earthquake was
          unusual in two ways: First, it was the country’s largest recorded
          quake and the fourth-largest in the world since 1935 when the Richter
          scale was introduced. Second, it complicated the picture for how we
          forecast the main shock of a large earthquake. Two days prior to the
          massive temblor, a magnitude-7.2 earthquake with three aftershocks
          greater than magnitude 6.0 hit offshore eastern Honshu. These quakes
          caused little damage even though the main rupture was only 8
          kilometers deep. It also produced a maximum 60-centimeter-high
          tsunami, which struck the coast half an hour after the quake. This
          fooled everyone. Given the earthquake’s large magnitude and the
          smaller aftershocks that occurred as expected over the next day, no
          one thought that these could be foreshocks of an even larger event.
          But it now looks like those quakes were all foreshocks for the
          magnitude-9.0 quake that hit two days later, just 40 kilometers north
          of the magnitude-7.2 event. As we have seen, it is indeed difficult to
          define any earth tremor as the main quake until after the whole
          sequence of earth shocks has occurred. Furthermore, despite advances
          in our knowledge of how and where earthquakes happen, our capability
          to predict exactly where and when the next earthquake will hit is in
          its infancy. Scientists may monitor geophysical or geochemical
          signatures (“precursors”) at critical fault zones, but it’s only with
          luck that they may forecast a Big One shortly before it hits. Over the
          long term, in determining when a major fault is “ripe” for an
          earthquake, scientists use the concepts of the earthquake cycle and
          seismic gaps.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of the cycle, we know that large earthquakes strike a given
          area periodically as a fault system releases accumulated stress. A
          seismic gap is part of a fault that has not experienced a large
          earthquake in a very long time. As the time between earthquakes grows
          longer, a Big One occurring on the gap becomes more likely, so the
          theory goes. The problem with relying on these methods is that we do
          not have a truly long-term scientific record of earthquakes for any
          given area on Earth. Therefore, our forecasts of earthquake cycles and
          seismic gaps are far from precise. In Japan, for example, in the early
          1990s, many seismologists suggested that the Great Kanto earthquake of
          1923 (a magnitude-8.2 quake that killed more than 140,000 people in
          Tokyo and Yokohama) would repeat itself sometime in the mid-1990s to
          the early-2000s based on a 70- to 80-year cycle. But it didn’t strike.
          Instead, a megaquake hit Awaji Island and the nearby populous city of
          Kobe, killing 6,400 people in 1995. Nevertheless, it is important to
          collect and analyze as much data as possible about past and present
          earthquakes. Some of Japan’s other largest quakes that have hit off
          Honshu and produced tsunamis include an estimated magnitude 8.6 in
          July A.D. 869, an estimated magnitude 8.5 in June 1896, a magnitude
          8.4 in March 1933 and a magnitude 7.4 in June 1978. The
          seismo-tectonic relationship between these past earthquakes and the
          March 2011 megaquakes off northeast Honshu will be of particular
          interest to geoscientists. But it will likely be awhile before we have
          a big picture of how these events were related. Meanwhile, the risk of
          the Big One hitting the populous Kanto region, where Tokyo is located,
          is far from over. Recent fault stress modeling by Ross Stein of the
          U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., and Shinji Toda of Kyoto
          University in Japan suggests that after the March 11 megaquake, the
          crustal stress off Honshu may have transferred to adjacent segments
          along the subduction zone and thus loaded the existing faults in the
          upper plate with increased stress. Although we may still have a lot of
          questions about how and when megaquakes occur, one thing is becoming
          clearer with each passing earthquake disaster: No single nation can be
          fully prepared against natural disasters, and international sharing of
          science and technology on geohazards is crucial for humanity.

          The Great Kantō earthquake (関東大地震, Kantō dai-jishin) struck the
          Kantō Plain on the main Japanese island of Honshū on Saturday, September 1, 1923. Varied accounts
          indicate the duration of the earthquake was between four and ten
          minutes. The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.9 on the moment
          magnitude scale , with its focus deep beneath Izu Ōshima
          Island in Sagami Bay. The cause was a rupture of part of the
          convergent boundary where the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting
          beneath the Okhotsk Plate along the line of the Sagami Trough. This
          earthquake devastated Tokyo, the port city of Yokohama, and the
          surrounding prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa, and Shizuoka, and caused
          widespread damage throughout the Kantō region. The earthquake's force
          was so great that in Kamakura, over 60 km from the epicenter,
          it moved the Great Buddha statue, which weighs about 121 tonnes,
          almost 60 centimetres. Estimated casualties totaled about 142,800
          deaths, including about 40,000 who went missing and were presumed
          dead. According to the Japanese construction company
          Kajima Kobori Research's conclusive report of September 2004, 105,385
          deaths were confirmed in the 1923 quake. The damage from
          this natural disaster was one of the greatest sustained by Imperial
          Japan. In 1960, the government declared September 1, on the 37th
          anniversary of the quake, as an annual "Disaster Prevention Day".
          Because the earthquake struck at lunchtime when many people were
          cooking meals over fire, many people died as a result of the many
          large fires that broke out. Fires started immediately after the
          earthquake.Some fires developed into
          firestormsthat swept across cities.
          Many people died when their feet became stuck on melting tarmac. The
          single greatest loss of life was caused by a fire tornado that
          engulfed the Rikugun Honjo Hifukusho (formerly the Army Clothing
          Depot) in downtown Tokyo, where about 38,000 people were incinerated
          after taking shelter there after the earthquake. The earthquake broke
          water mains all over the city, and putting out the fires took nearly
          two full days until late in the morning of September 3.[22] A strong
          typhoon centered off the coast of the Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa
          Prefecture brought high winds to Tokyo Bay at about the same time as
          the earthquake. These winds caused fires to spread rapidly. The
          Emperor and Empress were staying at Nikko when the earthquake struck
          Tokyo, and were never in any danger.American Acting Consul
          General Max David Kirjassoff and his wife Alice Josephine Ballantine
          Kirjassoff died in the earthquake and were buried in
          Yokohama. Many homes were buried or swept away by
          landslides in the mountainous and hilly coastal areas in western
          Kanagawa Prefecture; about 800 people died. A collapsing mountainside
          in the village of Nebukawa, west of Odawara, pushed the entire village
          and a passenger train carrying over 100 passengers, along with the
          railway station, into the sea. The RMS Empress of Australia was about
          to leave Yokohama harbour when the earthquake struck. It narrowly
          survived and assisted in rescuing 2000 survivors. Marunouchi in flames
          A tsunami with waves up to 10 m high struck the coast of
          Sagami Bay, Bōsō Peninsula, Izu Islands, and the east coast of Izu
          Peninsula within minutes. The tsunami caused many deaths, including
          about 100 people along Yui-ga-hama Beach in Kamakura and an estimated
          50 people on the Enoshima causeway. Over 570,000 homes were destroyed,
          leaving an estimated 1.9 million homeless. Evacuees were transported
          by ship from Kantō to as far as Kobe in Kansai.The damage is
          estimated to have exceeded US$1 billion (or about $15 billion
          today).There were 57 aftershocks.
